# JuzBlog

A project to create a simple, **multi-user** blog platform.

The Project will:
* use PDO for database interactions,
* have **markdown** support for writing posts,
* admin page with user and post review/delete capability,
* admin page data/statistic visualisations.



_note: this is also an ongoing learning exercise, thus it's a bit messy here and there and no doubt there's some rookie snafus too. Constructive criticism gratefully accepted._

Parsedown [https://github.com/erusev/parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)
